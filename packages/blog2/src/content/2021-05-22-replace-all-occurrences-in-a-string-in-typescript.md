Today we discuss [ReplaceAll](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/119-medium-replaceall/README.md)

We need to remove all occurrences in the string and place instead the different value

Let's start ‚è≥

## Replace all occurrences

Let's check [the solution for `Replace`](/2021-05-17-replace-occurrence-in-a-string-in-typescript/) and adapt it for `ReplaceAll`:

![Replace, solution](/replace-all-occurrences-in-a-string-in-typescript/step2-replace-solution.png)

This solution substitutes `From` for `To` once: https://tsplay.dev/mA7ZXw

Let's do that as many times as required:

![ReplaceAll, version 1](/replace-all-occurrences-in-a-string-in-typescript/step3-solution-v1.png)

But if we call `ReplaceAll` recursively this way, we will do it incorrectly. Let me give an example:

![Not working example for version 1](/replace-all-occurrences-in-a-string-in-typescript/step4-example-for-v1-solution.png)

So instead of calling `ReplaceAll` for the whole string, let's do it for the rest of the string, or `End`:

Thank you for your time! ‚åõÔ∏è
