## Intro

Last week, on April 15, 2025, I was awarded the **UK Global Talent** visa for **Exceptional Talent** route. This is a visa designed to recognise leaders in the tech industry - and in this article, I'd like to share the projects that helped me earn it.

Whether you're considering applying or just curious about what kind of impact is needed, I hope this post offers insight and motivation. While I can't share the original documents due to NDAs and IP, I'll walk you through the key highlights that made up my case.
