![Max and I discuss StringToNumber on Holy.js](/advanced-types-holyjs-notes/image.png)

On November, 5, together with [Max](https://github.com/ColCh) we had a talk about [Advanced types in TypeScript on HolyJS](https://holyjs-moscow.ru/en/talks/advanced-types-in-typescript/).

If you'd like to watch the entire talk in Russian, a recording is available on YouTube:

## Why do we need types?

Based on the book of [Benjamin C. Pierce ‚Äì¬†Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/index.html), type systems in general are good for:

1. Detecting errors
2. Abstraction
3. Documentation
4. Language safety
5. Efficiency

Of course, it allows early detection of some programming errors. It can be not only trivial mental slips (e.g. forgetting to convert a string to a number), but also deeper conceptual errors (e.g. neglecting a boundary condition, confusing units and etc.)

Regarding abstraction, type systems structure large systems in terms of modules with clear interfaces.

Types are also useful when reading programmes and cannot be outdated unlike comments.

If we talk about safety, we can define it as types make it impossible to shoot yourself in the foot while programming.

And last but not least, it's efficiency as high-performance compilers rely heavily on information gathered by the type checker during optimisation and code-generation phases.

In terms of TypeScript, we use it for the same reasons. Let's focus on the first 3 items:

1. Detecting errors

```typescript title="Analysing AST-tree, TypeScript finds and shows errors"
type Status = "loading" | "loaded" | "error";

let currentStatus: Status;

currentStatus = "loading";
currentStatus = "loaded";
currentStatus = "error";
// Type '"lagged"' is not assignable to type 'Status'
currentStatus = "lagged";
```

2. Abstraction

```typescript title="Creating new entities with types and interfaces"
type SquareMeters = number;

interface Room {
  area: SquareMeters;
}
interface Flat {
  rooms: Room[];
}
interface House {
  flats: Flat[];
}
interface District {
  houses: House[];
}
interface City {
  districts: District[];
}
interface Country {
  cities: City[];
}
```

3. Documentation

```typescript title="React component Label which accepts object props with 2 fields ‚Äì¬†selected and title"
interface LabelPropsType {
  selected?: boolean;
  title: string;
}

export const Label = ({ selected = false, title }: LabelPropsType) => (
  <a href={selected ? `/search` : `/search?label=${title}`}>{title}</a>
);
```

## Basic types

Before discussing advanced types, I would like to touch on some examples of the basic types:

1. `Pick` allows us to get the object with the fields that we need.

```typescript title="Example of Pick"
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  alive: boolean;
}

//  { name: string; }
type PersonWithNameOnly = Pick<Person, "name">;
//  { name: string; age: number; }
type PersonWithNameAndAge = Pick<Person, "name" | "age">;
```

2. `Exclude` allows to remove elements from union type

```typescript title="Example of Exclude"
type Status = "loading" | "loaded" | "error";

//  "loading" | "loaded"
type StatusWithoutErrorOnly = Exclude<Status, "error">;
//  "error"
type ErrorStatus = Exclude<Status, "loading" | "loaded">;
```

3. We use `never` in different constructions. We can draw an anology between `never` for union types and the empty set.

```typescript title="Example of keyword never"
type Status = "loading" | "loaded" | "error";

//  never
type SuccessStatus = Exclude<Status, Status>;
```

4. Tuples, which works like arrays but the number of elements is always fixed.

```typescript title="Example of tuples"
type Statuses = ["loading", "loaded", "error"];
type VideoFormats = ["mp4", "mov", "wmv", "avi"];
type EmptyTuple = [];
```

```typescript title="Spread in tuples"
type TupleWithZero = [0];

type Test1 = [1, ...TupleWithZero, 1]; // [1, 0, 1]
type Test2 = [...TupleWithZero, 1, ...TupleWithZero]; // [0, 1, 0]
```

5. Arrays, to be able to store multiple values, e.g. array of numbers or strings.

```typescript title="Example of arrays"
interface School {
  log: Record<string, number[]>;
}

type MathMarks = School["log"]["math"]; // number[]
type Subjects = (keyof School["log"])[]; // string[]
```

## Advanced types

Let's now discuss some examples of advanced types

1. Construction like `T extends string` can be used in 2 cases: Generic constrains (where we can restrict the accepted types) and conditional types (where e.g. we can check if it's a string or not)

```typescript title="Examples of generic constraints and conditional types"
type AcceptsStrings<T extends string> = `${string}${T}`;
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? true : false;

// ‚ùå Type 'number' does not satisfy the constraint 'string'
type Test1 = AcceptsStrings<number>;
type Test2 = IsString<number>; // false
```

These 2 examples show the difference: `number` in `Test1` will be marked as the error in Typescript while `Test2` will be just `false`.

2. Mapped types allow us to create an object with new keys and values. For example, we made 2 objects with identical keys and values.

```typescript title="Example of mapped types"
type KeyToKeyMapping<Keys extends PropertyKey> = { [K in Keys]: K };

//  { 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3; }
type Test1 = KeyToKeyMapping<1 | 2 | 3>;
// { a: "a"; b: "b"; c: "c"; }
type Test2 = KeyToKeyMapping<"a" | "b" | "c">;
```

3. Conditional types can use keyword `infer` to be able to identify what we have on the specific place.

```typescript title="Inference in conditional types"
// type ReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any

type Test1 = ReturnType<() => void>; // void
type Test2 = ReturnType<() => number>; // number
type Test3 = ReturnType<() => boolean>; // boolean
```

If we use basic type `ReturnType`, we can get the return value of the function, e.g. `void`, `number` and `boolean` respectively.

4. Given type or interface, we can get the keys with keyword `keyof`

```typescript title="Examples of keyof"
type Person = { name: string };
type School = { pupils: Person[]; teachers: Person[] };

type Test1 = keyof Person; // "name"
type Test2 = keyof School & string; // "pupils" | "teachers"
```

5. Recursive condition types are condition types where we can use another recursive call to get results.

```typescript title="Putting characters into the tuple"
type CharacterIteration<T> = T extends `${infer Ch}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Ch, ...CharacterIteration<Rest>]
  : [];

type Test1 = CharacterIteration<"123">; //  ["1", "2", "3"]
type Test2 = CharacterIteration<"">; // []
```

Also here we can see the iteration over string literal type using `` T extends `${infer Ch}${infer Rest}`  ``

6. Using `[T] extends [U]` we can check that one type can equal to another one. But we also have an exception in `any` here.

```typescript title="Check if types are equal"
type Equals<T, U> = [T] extends [U] ? ([U] extends [T] ? true : false) : false;

type Test1 = Equals<never, never>; //  true
type Test2 = Equals<unknown, any>; //  true üßê
type Test3 = Equals<1, number>; //  false
```

7. Check for a string literal type which still requires `T extends string` conditional type to return `false` for anything other than `string`

```typescript title="Check for string literal type"
type IsStringLiteral<T> = T extends string
  ? string extends T
    ? false
    : true
  : false;

type Test1 = IsStringLiteral<string>; // false
type Test2 = IsStringLiteral<"123">; // true
type Test3 = IsStringLiteral<123>; // false
```

8. To be able to convert tuples to number literal type, we can use `length`

```typescript title="Tuple to number literal type examples"
type Test1 = []["length"]; // 0
type Test2 = [1, 2, 3]["length"]; // 3
```

9. This conditional types is used for union type elements iteration and it's called distributed conditional types

```typescript title="Example of distributed conditional types"
type UnionIteration<T> = T extends unknown ? [T] : never;

type Test1 = UnionIteration<never>; //  never
type Test2 = UnionIteration<1>; //  [1]
type Test3 = UnionIteration<1 | 2>; //  [1] | [2]
```

## Basic or advanced types?

Let's have a look at [Advanced Types | TypeScript docs v1](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html) where the advanced type was defined. It says:

> This page lists some of the more advanced ways in which you can model types, it works in tandem with the [Utility Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html) doc which includes types which are included in TypeScript and available globally.

In [Creating Types from Types | TypeScript docs v2](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/types-from-types.html) TypeScript steps aside from this term, but the idea is still the same:

> By combining various type operators, we can express complex operations and values in a succinct, maintainable way.

And below there are 7 ways to express a new type in TypeScript:

- [Generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) - Types which take parameters
- [Keyof Type Operator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/keyof-types.html) - Using the keyof operator to create new types
- [Typeof Type Operator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/typeof-types.html) - Using the typeof operator to create new types
- [Indexed Access Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/indexed-access-types.html) - Using `Type['a']` syntax to access a subset of a type
- [Conditional Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html) - Types which act like if statements in the type system
- [Mapped Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html) - Creating types by mapping each property in an existing type
- [Template Literal Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html) - Mapped types which change properties via template literal strings

## Ways to express advanced types

We will discuss only 4 ways of expressing advanced types:

1. Number literal types
2. [Tuples](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#tuple-types)
3. [String or Template literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html)
4. [Mapped types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html)

### Number literal types

We can come to number literal types from tuples by accessing `Tuple['length']`

```typescript title="Example of number literal types inference"
type ToTuple<T> = any; // implementation
type BinaryToDecimal<T> = any; // implementation

type BinaryNumber = "101";
type Step1 = ToTuple<BinaryNumber>; // [1, 0, 1]
type Step2 = BinaryToDecimal<Step1>; // [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
type Result = Step2["length"]; // 5
```

More details about number literal types in [TypeScript Issue#26382 ‚Äì Math with Number Literal Type](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/26382)

### Tuples

We can create tuples

```typescript title="Creating tuples of different length"
type Statuses = ["loading", "loaded", "error"];
type VideoFormats = ["mp4", "mov", "wmv", "avi"];
type EmptyTuple = [];
```

We are able to iterate over them from the beginning and the end

```typescript title="Iteration over tuples"
type FindFromStart<U, T> = T extends [infer Head, ...infer Tail]
  ? U extends Head
    ? true
    : FindFromStart<U, Tail>
  : false;

type Example1 = FindFromStart<1, [1, 2, 3]>; // true
type Example2 = FindFromStart<0, [1, 2, 3]>; // false

type FindFromEnd<U, T> = T extends [...infer Start, infer Last]
  ? U extends Last
    ? true
    : FindFromEnd<U, Start>
  : false;

type Example3 = FindFromEnd<1, [1, 2, 3]>; // true
type Example4 = FindFromEnd<0, [1, 2, 3]>; // false
```

As you see, we also used them in conditional types to match some pattern. For example, the tuple `T` has at least one element with `T extends [infer Head, ...infer Tail]`

And also we can transform string literal types to tuples if we have difficulties doing it for string literal types.

### String literal types

We can create string literal types

```typescript title="Creating string literal types"
// types only
type Mp4Extension = "mp4";
// runtime + types
let extension: Mp4Extension = "mp4";
// @ts-expect-error ‚ùå Type '"mp3"' is not assignable to type '"mp4"'
extension = "mp3";
```

We can iterate over them but from the beginning only

```typescript title="Iteration over string literal types"
type FindFromStart<U, T> = T extends `${infer Head}${infer Tail}`
  ? U extends Head
    ? true
    : FindFromStart<U, Tail>
  : false;

type Example1 = FindFromStart<"1", "123">; // true
type Example2 = FindFromStart<"0", "123">; // false
```

As for tuples, we also can use string literal types in conditional types to match some pattern. For example, the string literal type `T` has at least one character with `` T extends `${infer Head}${infer Tail}` ``

### Mapped types

And finally, it's mapped types

We can extract either keys or values of just created mapped types. Also depending on the task, we can express new dependencies of keys and values

```typescript title="Identical keys and values with mapped types"
type KeyToKeyMapping<Keys extends PropertyKey> = { [K in Keys]: K };

//  { 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3; }
type Test1 = KeyToKeyMapping<1 | 2 | 3>;
// { a: "a"; b: "b"; c: "c"; }
type Test2 = KeyToKeyMapping<"a" | "b" | "c">;
```

## Type challenges

To understand how advanced types are working, let's have a look at [type-challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges)

> It's the collection of TypeScript type challenges with online judge

> This project is aimed at helping you better understand how the type system works, writing your own utilities, or just having fun with the challenges

Here we will concentrate on category "hard"

### Testing challenges

If you're not familiar with the format of the challenges, one of the most important part of it ‚Äì¬†passing the tests. Here I want to let you know how it's working.

```typescript title="Playground format of taking challenges"
/*
  Description about the challenge
*/

/* _____________ Your Code Here _____________ */

type ChallengeToImplement<T> = any;

/* _____________ Test Cases _____________ */
import { Equal, Expect } from "@type-challenges/utils";

type Parameter1 = any;
type ExpectedResult1 = any;
type Parameter2 = any;
type ExpectedResult2 = any;

type cases = [
  Expect<Equal<ChallengeToImplement<Parameter1>, ExpectedResult1>>,
  Expect<Equal<ChallengeToImplement<Parameter2>, ExpectedResult2>>
];
```

Usually we have some implementation which we want to test (here it's `ChallengeToImplement`).

Then under a part with "Test Cases" we import two functions ‚Äì¬†`Equal` and `Expect`:

- `Expect` accepts one parameter and check if it's `true`. Otherwise, we will see TypeScript error that it's not `true`.
- `Equal` accepts two parameters and check that they are equal. If they are, it returns `true`.

At the bottom we create `type cases` where we define all the checks. If all checks are working, we won't see any TypeScript errors

## Solutions

### Tuple Filter

To show the potential of tuples, we have a challenge about `TupleFilter`

- [Challenge](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/399-hard-tuple-filter/README.md)
- [Solution](/2021-11-27-tuple-filter/)

### Split

`Split` is next challenge where we manipulate string literal types

- [Challenge](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/2822-hard-split/README.md)
- [Solution](/2021-11-29-split/)

### StringToNumber

To get familiar with number literal types, we will check `StringToNumber`

- [Challenge](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/300-hard-string-to-number/README.md)
- [Solution](/2021-12-03-string-to-number/)

### GetOptional

And last challenge `GetOptional` is about mapped types

- [Challenge](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/59-hard-get-optional/README.md)
- [Solution](/2021-12-07-get-optional/)

## Conclusion

So we had a look at the basic and advanced types and their difference.

We've seen that the implementation of the solution for challenges requires advanced types and that even between different challenges we have a lot in common ‚Äì¬†terms, expressions and constructions.

Knowing how to work with the specific way of creating new types doesn't really mean that you will know all the ways without problems.

We also know that TypeScript has a wide set of terms (basic or advanced) which makes it possible to solve different types of challenges.

Regarding the usage, given advanced types, we're able to solve different challenges. And there are different projects, for example:

- [type-fest](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest)
- [ts-essentials](https://github.com/krzkaczor/ts-essentials)
- [ts-toolbelt](https://github.com/millsp/ts-toolbelt)

where those advanced types are already implemented and can be used in your project.

We can read the codebase now and contribute to these kinds of projects which makes us even better üöÄ
