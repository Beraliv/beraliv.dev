![Example of Absolute use](/absolute-in-typescript/step1-example-of-use.png)

Today we discuss [Absolute](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/529-medium-absolute/README.md)

To return a number here is a very complicated task because a number of iterations is limited (if we try to solve it with arrays). Instead we can use string literals and return a string as a result.

Here we go ðŸš€

## Return result for the string

If we have a string, and we know that there's a number in it, we can check for a minus sign at the beginning:

![Positive in case we have negative](/absolute-in-typescript/step2-return-result-for-string.png)

Otherwise, we return the same string as we expect it to be positive

## Return result for the number and bigint

Still we return the same number or bigint if we pass it to `Absolute`

As we already can manipulate numbers in a string, let's put a number to a string:

And now all the tests are passed âœ…Â â€“ https://tsplay.dev/WJ9oRm

Good night â›ˆðŸŒ™
