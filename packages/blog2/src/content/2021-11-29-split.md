```typescript title="Example of Split use"
type Split<S extends string, Separator extends string> = any; // implementation

type cases = [
  Expect<Equal<Split<"Two words", " ">, ["Two", "words"]>>,
  Expect<Equal<Split<"One-word", "">, ["O", "n", "e", "-", "w", "o", "r", "d"]>>
];
```

Today we discuss [Split](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/2822-hard-split/README.md)

The type `Split` is identical to the method `Array.prototype.split` in JavaScript

Let's step by step implement it ðŸ”¥

## Substrings

To be able to extract words from the string, we will use recursive conditional type.

```typescript title="Iteration over the tuple"
type Split<
  S extends string,
  Separator extends string
> = S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Word, ...Split<Rest, Separator>]
  : [];
```

Here we use `` S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}` `` to match the pattern `` `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}` ``.

It means that if we have a separator, it will infer left and right parts.

On the left part `Word` we have a word so we will put it into the tuple.

For the right part `Rest` we have the rest of a string, so let's recursively do until we have an empty string.

Let's save the result in Playground â€“Â https://tsplay.dev/N52MBm and check if it's working correctly.

```typescript title="Checking the cases where separator is not a part of the string"
type Split<
  S extends string,
  Separator extends string
> = S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Word, ...Split<Rest, Separator>]
  : [];

type Test1 = Split<"Hi! How are you?", "z">; // []
type Test2 = Split<"Hi! How are you?", " ">; // ["Hi!", "How", "are"]
```

First 2 cases return incorrect results.

We expect `["Hi! How are you?"]` for `Test1` and `["Hi!", "How", "are", "you?"]` for `Test2` but didn't get the last word for both of them.

That happens because on the last iteration where we cannot match the pattern `` `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}` `` so it returns nothing instead of the last word.

Let's fix it ðŸ§ª

## Separator is not a part of the string

To be able to fix the last iteration, let's return the rest of the string.

```typescript title="Return [S] at the last iteration"
type Split<
  S extends string,
  Separator extends string
> = S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Word, ...Split<Rest, Separator>]
  : [S];
```

and check the Playground as well â€“ https://tsplay.dev/NDGM4w

We see that previous cases are fixed now

Let's have a look at the next broken.

```typescript title="Checking cases where we have empty string at the end of tuple"
type Split<
  S extends string,
  Separator extends string
> = S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Word, ...Split<Rest, Separator>]
  : [S];

// ["H", "i", "!", " ", "H", "o", "w", " ", "a", "r", "e", " ", "y", "o", "u", "?", ""]
type Test1 = Split<"Hi! How are you?", "">;
```

We see that we got empty string at the end of the tuple.

For empty separator pattern matching `` `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}` `` always goes to "then" branch except for the case with the empty string `S` at the last iteration

```typescript title="Last iteration with empty string"
// [""]
type LastIteration = "" extends `${infer Word}${""}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Word, Rest]
  : [""];
```

## Incorrect empty string in the result

So we faced the issue with the empty string at the last iteration.

Let's check if we have an empty string `S`, and if we have it, we don't add it to the result:

```typescript title="Handle empty string S"
type Split<
  S extends string,
  Separator extends string
> = S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Word, ...Split<Rest, Separator>]
  : S extends ""
  ? []
  : [S];
```

We only added an auxiliary conditional type `S extends ""`

If we check the Playground with this solution â€“Â https://tsplay.dev/m0LMqm, we see this is fixed now.

Let's check another broken case with the empty string.

```typescript title="Empty string S for non-empty separator"
type Split<
  S extends string,
  Separator extends string
> = S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Word, ...Split<Rest, Separator>]
  : S extends ""
  ? []
  : [S];

type Test1 = Split<"", "z">; // []
```

By the spec of `Array.prototype.split`, it should return an array with an empty string if the separator is not empty

```typescript title="JavaScript example with empty string and non-empty separator"
"".split("z"); // [""]
```

Let's handle this edge case as well.

```typescript title="Handle empty string S with non-empty separator"
type Split<
  S extends string,
  Separator extends string
> = S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Word, ...Split<Rest, Separator>]
  : S extends ""
  ? Separator extends ""
    ? []
    : [S]
  : [S];
```

Good, now it's working as expected â€“Â https://tsplay.dev/wEDMyW ðŸŽ‰

## Difference between string and string literal type

If we have a look at the previous solution, we see that we still have one broken test. Let's take a closer look.

```typescript
type Split<
  S extends string,
  Separator extends string
> = S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Word, ...Split<Rest, Separator>]
  : S extends ""
  ? Separator extends ""
    ? []
    : [S]
  : [S];

type Test1 = Split<string, "whatever">; // [string]
```

If we split `string`, we want to see `string[]` as the result, right? We need to understand how to distinguish strings and string literal types.

Let's come up with the solution for it:

```typescript title="Difference between string and string literal type"
type IsStringLiteralType<T> = any; // implementation

type cases = [
  Expect<Equal<IsStringLiteralType<string>, false>>,
  Expect<Equal<IsStringLiteralType<number>, false>>,
  Expect<Equal<IsStringLiteralType<"123">, true>>,
  Expect<Equal<IsStringLiteralType<123>, false>>
];
```

First of all, we understand that we have a string with conditional type `T extends string` so let's add it first.

```typescript title="Check if it's a string or string literal type"
type IsStringLiteralType<T> = T extends string ? true : false;
```

To be able to check the solution, let's have a look at the one broken case â€“Â https://tsplay.dev/WG6Bvm

```typescript title="Incorrect case for string"
type IsStringLiteralType<T> = T extends string ? true : false;

type Test1 = IsStringLiteralType<string>; // true
```

We see that for `string` we still return `true` which is not right.

On the other hand, if we take `string extends T`, that checks that we have only `string` which is what we really want. Let's handle it differently for `string`:

```typescript title="Final solution for IsStringLiteralType"
type IsStringLiteralType<T> = T extends string
  ? string extends T
    ? false
    : true
  : false;
```

Now it looks ready and we can apply this knowledge for the last bug we had with `Split`:

```typescript title="Final solution for Split"
type Split<
  S extends string,
  Separator extends string
> = S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Word, ...Split<Rest, Separator>]
  : S extends ""
  ? Separator extends ""
    ? []
    : [S]
  : string extends S
  ? S[]
  : [S];
```

We only use `string extends S` as we already have a generic constrain for `S` â€“Â `S extends string` so we don't need to check that we have `number` or `boolean`

## Solution

```typescript title="Solution"
type Split<
  S extends string,
  Separator extends string
> = S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}`
  ? [Word, ...Split<Rest, Separator>]
  : S extends ""
  ? Separator extends ""
    ? []
    : [S]
  : string extends S
  ? S[]
  : [S];
```

Let's sum up the whole solution:

1. We iterate over the string from left to right, try to match the pattern with conditional type â€“Â `` S extends `${infer Word}${Separator}${infer Rest}` ``
2. We handle different edge cases: whether we have empty `S` or empty `Separator`
3. We don't forget about the passed string and handle it differently

To be able to check the whole solution with tests, please have a look at the Playground â€“Â https://tsplay.dev/mZaeoN
