Today we discuss [Replace](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/116-medium-replace/README.md)

We need to remove one occurrence in the string and place instead the different value

Let's do that üöÄ

## Replace occurrence

Let's first find occurrence within a string and replace it with the different value:

![Replace, version 1](/replace-occurrence-in-a-string-in-typescript/step2-solution-v1.png)

We don't know start and end but know for sure that `From` is in the string `S`.

That's not the perfect solution though: https://tsplay.dev/WGnp9m

So when the input string `S` is empty, we want to have it as a result. Let's replace `never` with `S`:

Still we missed the case where we try to replace empty `From`: https://tsplay.dev/WYJabw

Here we don't need to do anything:
