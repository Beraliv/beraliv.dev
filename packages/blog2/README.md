# blog.beraliv.dev

This is the blog page where I write articles about TypeScript ðŸ¦º and video players ðŸ“º

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

To be able to run the project, you run dev server

```bash
yarn dev
```

To be able to continue working on the project, you need to set environment variables:

1. [packages/blog2/src/functions/firebaseDb.ts](https://github.com/Beraliv/beraliv.dev/blob/main/packages/blog2/src/functions/firebaseDb.ts)

```ts
const privateKey = process.env.FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY;
const clientEmail = process.env.FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL;
```

These variables are required to work with Firebase. In this particular project, it's connected to see and update the views for every article.

2. [packages/blog2/src/validators/validateEnvParameters.ts](https://github.com/Beraliv/beraliv.dev/blob/main/packages/blog2/src/validators/validateEnvParameters.ts)

```ts
const apiKey = process.env.CONVERTKIT_PUBLIC_KEY;
const formId = process.env.CONVERTKIT_SIGNUP_FORM_ID;
```

This part is connected to ConvertKit. On the bottom of the page you will see the form where they are used.

Once, you've set them all, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
