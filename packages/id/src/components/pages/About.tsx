      <h2>My first steps into programming</h2>
      <p>
        <DropCap>B</DropCap>ack in school, programming was mostly a mystery to
        me. Our informatics classes didn't touch on programming languages, but
        my two classmates, Mikhail and Vsevolod, and I decided to take matters
        into our own hands and learn Pascal. We started from scratch, and while
        I wasn't writing complex programs yet, the experience was both
        challenging and rewarding. This early self-driven learning laid the
        foundation for my journey, since I could relocate to St. Petersburg to
        study Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time in university, I worked on a wide range of impressive
        projects that fueled my enthusiasm for problem-solving. I developed
        various applications, including a tower defense game using Unity and
        Blender, a messenger app in C#, an optimisation system for public
        transport written in Java, and even designed a custom programming
        language with Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). These projects
        helped me discover my passion for tackling complex challenges, though I
        still hadn't figured it out on a specific direction.
      </p>

      <h2>My career direction</h2>
      <p>
        <DropCap>S</DropCap>oon after completing my bachelor's degree, I stepped
        into the world of front-end development at EPAM Systems. From day one, I
        was impressed with JavaScript's flexibility and the nearly-instant
        feedback that front-end development offered. That was nothing quite like
        it, and I quickly grew to love the dynamic nature of building web
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing my master's degree, I relocated to Moscow to begin my
        journey at Yandex, where I was introduced to the fascinating world of
        video streaming and advertising. While my work with the video and
        advertising teams was focused solely on web browsers, which offered just
        a glimpse of the broader landscape, I quickly recognised the complexity,
        the range of challenges the industry faces, and the immense potential
        for growth. It was clear to me that this field had the depth and
        opportunity to become a long-term career path.
      </p>
      <p>
        After leaving Yandex, I relocated twice - first to Germany in 2020 and
        then to the UK in 2022. These moves exposed me to different cultures,
        making me adaptable and effective in global teams with diverse
        backgrounds. I've become comfortable working in various setups, whether
        remote, hybrid or in the office. The experience of hybrid environments
        also sparked fresh ideas, leading to many innovative solutions along the
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2025, I was awarded the UK Global Talent visa for the Exceptional
        Talent route, reflecting my long-term commitment to contributing to the
        UK's tech industry.{" "}

      <h2>Personal insights</h2>
      <p>
        <DropCap>I</DropCap> can't picture my life without my four-legged
        companion, Sheldon, a miniature Schnauzer - undoubtedly my best 'pet
        project' yet. He's a daily reminder that taking a step back from even
        the toughest problems can provide the clarity needed to return with a
        fresh perspective and find the right solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        To stay active, I play doubles tennis weekly, learn German with my
        Bavarian teacher, and practice new piano pieces to entertain my wife. I
        also enjoy gaming, especially strategy games like StarCraft and
        Hearthstone, as well as online adventures like World of WarCraft, where
        I team up with friends for fun dungeon explorations.

        As an Assertive Architect (

        ), my personality reflects my natural introversion, vivid imagination
        and open-mindedness. I prioritise objectivity and rational thinking,
        favour structured planning over spontaneity, and remain calm under
        pressure.

        years in the video streaming industry across 3 countries, building
        cloud-based products and designing reliable HTML5 video players for both
        Web and Connected devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I primarily work with TypeScript, JavaScript, Web APIs (such as Media
        Source Extensions, or MSE, and Encrypted Media Extensions, or EME).
        Occasionally, I also dive into HTML and CSS.

        as a Senior Software Engineer. I am a part of Player Core team and work
        on improving user experience of the video players across HTML5 devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began my journey on the Player Core team, working on an in-house
        functional framework, called FABRiC. This tool enables the creation of
        automated tests for video playback across multiple devices, whether
        locally or remotely. Through the experience, I deepened my understanding
        of building reliable cloud-based products.
      </p>
      <p>
        After my first year at DAZN, I transitioned to focusing on Mercury, the
        in-house HTML5 player. I delved deeply into MSE while onboarding various
        platforms. One of R&D projects I worked on had valuable, which I later
        shared with my team and the broader industry during{" "}

      <p>
        In 2024, I led several key projects. One of the most rewarding was the
        R&D initiative focused on reducing latency in live playback. Our team
        faced numerous challenges, including close collaboration with the Google
        Chrome Dev Team to resolve{" "}

          text="a video/audio de-sync issue"
          external
        />
        . Another major effort involved optimising closed captions, where I took
        the lead in designing, planning and implementing a solution that
        significantly reduced the bundle size and improved the overall UX across
        various devices.

        Senior Software Engineer. I played a key role in bridging the gap
        between the Player and Connected Devices teams.

        I worked on many exciting projects, such as enhancing UX in the player
        on Samsung TVs, improving the trailer player across Connected Devices
        and onboarding PS5. These initiatives taught me a great deal about
        quirks of various devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm proud of driving a knowledge sharing sessions both in and beyond the
        team. At work, I organised daily sessions that significantly improved
        TypeScript expertise in Connected Devices team. These sessions also led
        to enhancements in the codebase, making the code more stable,
        predictable and readable. Outside of work, I shared my TypeScript
        findings on my blog and gave a talk on{" "}

      <h2>Yandex</h2>
      <p>
        <DropCap> B</DropCap>etween 2018 and 2020, I worked at{" "}

          text="Yandex Technologies"

        as Senior Frontend Developer on the Video and Advertising teams,
        improving video and advertising players used across Yandex services and
        partner platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Yandex, I discovered what it truly means to be an engineer: I took
        the responsibility for the entire process, from system design to
        deployment and monitoring, focussed on the bigger picture rather than
        just individual product features and prioritised long-term quality and
        maintainability over short-term outcomes. During this time, I also
        learned the fundamentals of building reliable video and advertising
        players on Web. I became familiar with industry libraries (such as
        shaka-player, hls.js and dash.js), gaining a solid understanding of
        video standards (like DASH and HLS) as well as advertising
        specifications (such as VMAP, VAST and VPAID).
      </p>
      <p>
        I was very lucky to work on multiple projects, including enhancing the
        video player with highlights, optimising network performance in video
        and advertising players, reducing ad fatigue for users and redesigning
        the advertising player UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a side initiative, I volunteered as a tutor to over 110 students at{" "}

        from 2018 and 2020. Additionally, my colleague and I designed a problem
        for{" "}

        , organised by Yandex in 2019. This experience significantly broadened
        my expertise in participating in such events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around that time, TypeScript began gaining popularity as a common
        dependency in many web projects. Faced with various challenges in
        TypeScript, I eventually stumbled upon the{" "}

        challenges worked, and after several years, I started sharing TypeScript
        insights with my colleagues. I highly recommend exploring type
