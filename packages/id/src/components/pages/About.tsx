        My first steps into programming
      </h2>
      <p>
        <DropCap>B</DropCap>ack in school, programming was mostly a mystery to
        me. Our informatics classes didn't touch on programming languages. In
        2011, my two classmates, Mikhail and Vsevolod, and I decided to take
        matters into our own hands and learn Pascal. We started from scratch,
        and while I wasn't writing complex programs yet, the experience was both
        challenging and rewarding. This early self-driven learning laid the
        foundation for my journey, since I could relocate to St. Petersburg to
        study Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time in university, I worked on a wide range of impressive
        projects that fueled my enthusiasm for problem-solving. I developed
        various applications, including a tower defense game using Unity and
        Blender, a messenger app in C#, an optimisation system for public
        transport written in Java, and even designed a custom programming
        language with Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). These projects
        helped me discover my passion for tackling complex challenges, though I
        still hadn't figured it out on a specific direction.
      </p>

      <h2 id="my-career-direction">My career direction</h2>
      <p>
        <DropCap>S</DropCap>oon after completing my bachelor's degree, I stepped
        into the world of front-end development at EPAM Systems. From day one, I
        was impressed with JavaScript's flexibility and the nearly-instant
        feedback that front-end development offered. That was nothing quite like
        it, and I quickly grew to love the dynamic nature of building web
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing my master's degree, I moved to Moscow to join Yandex,
        where I was introduced to the fascinating world of video streaming and
        advertising. My work was focused primarily on web browsers, offering
        just a glimpse into the broader streaming ecosystem. Still, I quickly
        recognised the complexity of the domain, the unique technical challenges
        it presented, and its potential as a long-term career path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I shifted my focus to the finance industry in 2025, I continue
        contributing to Open Source in the video streaming space, and sharing
        knowledge I hope will remain valuable to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since leaving Yandex, I relocated twice â€“ first to Germany in 2020, and
        then to the UK in 2022. These moves exposed me to different cultures,
        making me adaptable and effective in global teams with diverse
        backgrounds. I've become comfortable working in various setups, whether
        remote, hybrid or in the office. The experience of hybrid environments
        also sparked fresh ideas, leading to many innovative solutions along the
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2025, I was awarded the UK Global Talent visa under the Exceptional
        Talent route, a recognition of my contributions and a reflection of my
        long-term commitment to the UK's tech industry.{" "}

        I team up with friends for fun dungeon explorations.

        I began my journey on the Player Core team, working on an in-house

        advertising players on Web. I became familiar with industry libraries
        (such as shaka-player, hls.js and dash.js), gaining a solid
        understanding of video standards (like{" "}
