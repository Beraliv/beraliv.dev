```ts {numberLines}
type Flatten<T> = any // implementation

type Step1 = Flatten<[1, [2, [3, [4]]]]>
type Step2 = [1, ...Flatten<[2, [3, [4]]]>]
type Step3 = [1, 2, ...Flatten<[3, [4]]>]
type Step4 = [1, 2, 3, ...Flatten<[4]>]
type Result = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Today we discuss [Flatten](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/459-medium-flatten/README.md)

It works the same way as [Array.prototype.flat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat) when you pass `Infinity`

Let's find out how to do that in TypeScript ðŸ’ª

## Iteration over tuple elements

Knowing the approach from different challenges, as we want to save the structure (it will be tuple at the end), we apply [Type inference in conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#type-inference-in-conditional-types) with [Rest elements in Tuples](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-2/#non-trailing-rests).

We iterate over elements:

```ts {numberLines}
type Flatten<T> = T extends []
  ? []
  : T extends [infer Head, ...(infer Tail)]
    ? // make it flatten with Head and Tail
    : []
```

Then we have 2 cases:

1. If the element is a tuple, we apply changes recursively
2. Otherwise, we leave it as is

Let's add second case:

```ts {numberLines}
type Flatten<T> = T extends []
  ? []
  : T extends [infer Head, ...infer Tail]
  ? [Head, ...Flatten<Tail>]
  : []
```

## Call it recursively when needed

At the moment, if we have a look at Playground â€“Â https://tsplay.dev/w18bXW, we will find that not all tests are passed.

We forgot to apply function recursively when we have an element as tuple. Let's have an example here:

```ts {numberLines}
type Step1 = Flatten<[1, [2]]>
type Step2 = [1, ...Flatten<[[2]]>]
type Result = [1, [2]]
```

In this case we cannot just add it to result tuple, we need to call `Flatten` before and then put all the elements of it to the result type. Let's change the implementation based on that:

```ts {numberLines}
type Flatten<T> = T extends []
  ? []
  : T extends [infer Head, ...infer Tail]
  ? Head extends any[]
    ? [...Flatten<Head>, ...Flatten<Tail>]
    : [Head, ...Flatten<Tail>]
  : []
```

Now it's working as expected ðŸ”¥
