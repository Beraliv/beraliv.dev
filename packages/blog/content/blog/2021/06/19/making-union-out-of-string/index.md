![Example of StringToUnion use](./step1-example-of-use.png)

Today we discuss [StringToUnion](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/master/questions/531-medium-string-to-union/README.md)

Type transformations are useful for different types of tasks.

We already discussed:

- Tuple to Object in [Making object out of tuple](/2021-04-07-making-object-out-of-tuple/)
- Tuple to Union in [Making union out of tuple](/2021-04-27-making-union-out-of-tuple/)

Let's go üöÄ

## Iteration over a string

Let's start from the first character:

![Get first character, version 1](./step2-get-first-character-v1.png)

We cannot extract it using indices as we get `string`. Instead let's apply [Type inference in conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#type-inference-in-conditional-types):

![Get first character, version 2](./step3-get-first-character-v2.png)

## Putting characters into a union

Next step is to put other characters into a union.

As we already can get first character, let's apply it recursively:

![Final solution](./step4-solution.png)

On the final step where we have an empty string, it converts to `never`

If we deal with a union type, `never` is the type when we have no elements in it. But if we put any element in it, `never` will be removed from it:

![Never in a union type](./step5-never-in-a-union.png)

That's it üí´

Have a wonderful weekend ‚òÄÔ∏è
